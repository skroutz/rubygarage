- OO (+ modules)
- but also procedural (+ scripting)

# Because… REPL !
<div style="text-align: right; margin-right:15%">
(and interactive debugging)
</div>
<br>
### Read-Eval-Print-Loop
Much like Python's interactive Shell, 
<br>
but, you know... better
<br>
2 common repls: irb and pry
<br><br>
### debugging with pry
you can interactively call the debugger at any place you need in the code.

```ruby
puts 'Hello Ruby world!'
fancy_method('arguments')
binding.pry # <-- REPL starts here!
```
